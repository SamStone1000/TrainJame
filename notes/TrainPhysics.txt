* Starting
** Maximum Load
  + The maximum force a locomotive can output is equal to the friction
    between the wheels and rail
    - In other words the most force a locomotive can output (unless
      the engine can't produce more than this) is the locomotive's
      weight multiplied by the coeefficent of static friction of the
      wheels and rail (~.5 for steel-steel)
    - The most force a locomotive can output while stationary is
      called *starting tractive effort*
    - Thus if the train's static friction is greater then the starting
      tractive effort of all the locomotive's put together it cannot
      move, and trying to push the locomotives further will simply
      cause the wheels to spin
** Accelerating
  - The amount of power a locomotive can output is inversely
    proportional to the speed of the train
    - This means as the train accelerates and picks up speed, it's
      rate of accleration drops as the force output by the engine
      drops
      + The force for a desiel-electric motor can be approximated as
        =T=(Pn)/V=
        - T :: tractive effort of locomotive in newtons
        - P :: power of locomotive in watts
        - n :: efficency of locomotive in converting power to force
        - V :: speed of locomotive in m/s
    - Eventually this means the train can't accelerate past the point
      where the engine's tractive effort equals the rolling resistance
      of the train + air resistance
*** Math

* While Moving
- Once a train reaches the equilibrium point where tractive effort is
  equal to resistances, the train will stop accelerating and stay at a
  constant speed

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:force}
F = m \cdot a
\end{equation}

Force is given by equation \ref{eq:force} above.
